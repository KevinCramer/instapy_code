Using cronjobs you can run the follow.py code. By running the code with some system 
arguments you can specify on which account you want the strategy to run. How many people you want it to follow.
If it should like their top posts yes/no. If yes you can specify how many of the most recent posts it should like. 
The accounts to follow are drawn from a unique list for each account which has been pre processed to remove private accounts, 
and accounts that are not within the correct niche. 

You can also run the unfollow.py which unfollows the earliest x accounts you followed. You can specify the value x.
